# Sentimentel_analyzing_twitter_data-_with_Vader_Sentiment_Analysis
This is project is Sentimentel Analysis to the Twitter Data and used data visulation in the end, I accessed the datas with Twint.


So this project is about analyzing the twitter data which '#bar覺sp覺nar覺harekat覺', I did this project to see how news accuracy effect on Turkish people and to see how much fake news going on twitter and how much we believe it, how it effects us, I searched and got help from github, I dont own project codes at all.

I used twint to get the data from twitter because I couldn't get API, so my data was repeating. I don't recommend to use it at all but it is still effective way to finish it if  you don't have API.
